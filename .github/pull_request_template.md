## Please...

Send your Pull Requests with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Please follow [my coding conventions](PERFECTwall/CONTRIBUTING.md) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits.

One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like include a paragraph describing what changed and its impact.

## Thank you.
